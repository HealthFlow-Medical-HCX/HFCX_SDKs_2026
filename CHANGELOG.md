# Changelog

All notable monorepo-level changes are documented here. Per-SDK changelogs
live in each SDK directory (e.g. `sdk-java/CHANGELOG.md`).

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Monorepo bootstrap with Apache 2.0 license, contributing guide, and
  cross-SDK parity tracker.
- `sdk-java/` subtree (Sprint J1): three-module Maven build
  (`hfcx-sdk-core`, `hfcx-sdk-client`, `hfcx-sdk-examples`).
- `sdk-java/tests/integration/consumer-smoketest/` — verifies the SDK
  artifact is consumable from a clean Maven project.
- GitHub Actions workflow `java-test.yml` running `mvn verify` on every PR.
- Stubbed Maven Central publish workflow `java-publish.yml` (gated on
  release tags; OSSRH credentials supplied via GitHub Secrets).
